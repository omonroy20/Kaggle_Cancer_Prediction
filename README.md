# Kaggle_Cancer_Prediction
A project from my time in school. The project was to use a large data set full of potential predictors for cancer to try and see if there were a combination of variables that can accurately predict cancer. In order to succeed here, we needed to remove variables and add them in various combination to pick out the best variables. I had to get creative here and create 2 functions that'll automate all that while picking out the best iteration of a training/testing qda model. It worked remarkably well despite the fact that the amount of models we were allowed to use were heavily restricted due to kaggle competition rules, otherwise I would've just used Random Forest and got it all over with.
